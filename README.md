Solutions to problems I've worked on in Computational Physics.
I have authored the Lab Python scripts for a class in Computational
Physics at the University of Toronto. My Lab partner also has a 
github repository and his username is cwilson51.Some of the scripts
depend on files which can be found on the website for the textbook
Computational Physics by Mark Newman, ive included some in the file
Miscellaneous scripts needed.
